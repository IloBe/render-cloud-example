# render-cloud-example
This repository is used as testing example for [Render](https://render.com/) CI/CD services.

**Render** is a unified cloud platform to build and run apps and websites. Render provides all services in one place, including web services, static sites, background workers, cron jobs, Dockerfiles, private services, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

Since **Heroku** discontinued the free-tier account, Render is an alternative that provides free-tier services for small projects and hobbyists.
